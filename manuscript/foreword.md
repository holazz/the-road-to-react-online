# Foreword

I've been a React developer since its inception. When I first encountered it, there was an air of mystery around it, as it distinguished itself from competitors by emphasizing the exclusive use of components. Over a decade later, I can't imagine working with any other framework in the near future. React continues to reinvent itself while pushing other frameworks to evolve as well. As a freelance web developer collaborating closely with companies, React is my indispensable daily companion, enhancing my productivity on every project.

"The Road to React" debuted in 2016, and since then, I've almost rewritten it annually. This book teaches the core principles of React, guiding you through building a practical application in pure React without complex tooling. It covers everything from setting up the project to deploying it on a server. Each chapter includes additional recommended reading and exercises. By the end, you'll have the skills to develop your own React applications.

In The Road to React, I establish a solid foundation before exploring the broader React ecosystem. The book clarifies general concepts, patterns, and best practices for real-world React applications. Ultimately, you'll learn to build a React application from scratch, incorporating features such as pagination, client-side and server-side searching, and advanced UI interactions like sorting. My hope is that this book conveys my passion for React and JavaScript, helping you embark on your journey with confidence.

I hope you enjoy reading this book and that it helps you get started. If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at [@rwieruch](https://x.com/rwieruch) or [LinkedIn](https://tinyurl.com/c2y283mk). I would love to hear from you!

Since lots of sweat and tears went into writing this book, I would appreciate it if you could share it with your friends and coworkers. It would mean a lot to me and help me reach more people who want to learn web development. I dedicate this book to all the aspiring web developers eager to learn and grow.

Happy coding!
