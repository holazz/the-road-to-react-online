# Foreword

I've been a React developer since its inception. When I first encountered it, there was an air of mystery surrounding it as it distinguished itself from its competitors by emphasizing the exclusive use of components. Over a decade later, I find myself unable to envision working with any other framework in the near future. React continues to reinvent itself while pushing other frameworks around it to evolve too. As a freelance web developer collaborating closely with companies, React is my indispensable daily companion, enhancing my productivity in every project.

"The Road to React" made its debut in 2016, and since then, I've almost rewritten it annually. This book teaches the core principles of React, guiding you through building a practical application in pure React without complex tooling. The book covers everything from setting up the project to deploying it on a server. Each chapter includes additional recommended reading and exercises. By the end, you'll have the skills to develop your own React applications.

In "The Road to React," I establish a solid foundation before delving into the broader React ecosystem. The book clarifies general concepts, patterns, and best practices for real-world React applications. Ultimately, you'll learn to construct a React application from scratch, incorporating features such as pagination, client-side and server-side searching, and advanced UI interactions like sorting. My aspiration is that this book conveys my passion for React and JavaScript, helping you embark on your journey with confidence.
