# React Maintenance

Once a React application grows, maintenance becomes a priority. To prepare for this eventuality, we'll cover performance optimization, type safety, testing, and project structure. Each of these topics will strengthen your app to take on more functionality without losing quality.

Performance optimization prevents applications from slowing down by assuring efficient use of available resource. Typed programming languages like TypeScript detect bugs earlier in the feedback loop. Testing gives us more explicit feedback than typed programming, and provides a way to understand which actions can break the application. Lastly, a project structure supports the organized management of assets into folders and files, which is especially useful in scenarios where team members work in different domains.
