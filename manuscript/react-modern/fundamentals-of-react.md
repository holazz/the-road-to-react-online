# Fundamentals of React

In this first part of this learning experience, we'll cover the fundamentals of React, with which we'll create our first React project. Later we'll explore new use cases for React by implementing real features like client and server-side searching, remote data fetching, and advanced state management the same as developing an actual web application. By the end, you will have a fully running React application that interacts with real-world data.
