# Fundamentals of React

In the initial phase of this learning journey, we'll explore the essential foundations of React, guiding you through the creation of your first React project. As we progress, we'll dive deeper into React's capabilities, implementing practical features such as client- and server-side searching, remote data fetching, and advanced state management. This hands-on approach mirrors the development of a real-world web application. By the end, you'll have a fully functional React application that seamlessly interacts with real-world data.
